Project Description

This project was done as part of our Web Technologies Lab (morning session). Our lab instructor asked us to practice and implement some programs, so we started working on them as instructed.

After completing the given programs, I discussed with my friend about doing something new and practical. She agreed, and we decided to create a Student Daily Attendance Register using HTML and CSS.

We took help from ChatGPT to understand the structure and get relevant code. Initially, the code provided was not fully suitable, and we faced some issues, especially with the design and layout. We worked on improving it step by step, made necessary changes, and finally completed the project.

The design may not be perfect, but it is functional, neat, and acceptable for a beginner-level project. This project helped us improve our understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic web design concepts.
